My name is Thomas,Â  [thomeven@gmail.com](mailto:thomeven@gmail.com). I retired from work in April 2022 at the age of 62 and I am a passionate photographer of wildlife.
Grandkids, photography, macOS development and being in the Norwegian mountains keep me busy. In mid November 2024 there are about 80 birds and animals, mostly birds
on these website. I am updating when I think there are some photos to publish. I am not communication the site, I am using it myself to learn more about the birds.
There are links to Wikipedia articles for every bird and animal.

## Birds

Most of all, I capture photos of birds. Bird photo is about 90% waiting and traveling. My knowledge of birds is still minimal and I am learning something new almost
daily. Most important is; to respect the birds and not chase them. Learn about where the different species are and sit down.  There are also some photos of wild
animals. Some animals were just discovered; e.g., I was in the right spot at the right time, and the camera was ready. Muskox and moose are captured
on photo trips in Norway.

##  Nature

I have, as long as I can remember, loved being in nature. Photography has also been one of my hobbies for years. Nature and wildlife are under pressure.
Many politicians do not understand the importance of preserving nature and wildlife. Every day I learn more about nature, how fragile it is, and how
everything in nature is somehow connected. And humans are experts in destroying nature through ignorance and economic motivations. That frightens me.

## Sony gear

For the last 5 years, I have only used Sony gear. Previous Sony camera bodies are Sony fullframes A7iii and Sony A9ii. I have also used lenses from
Tamron and Sigma, but all are sold. My gear now:

- Sony full-frame A1 camera body
- Sony FE 600mm F4.0 GM OSS lens
- Sony FE 300mm F2.8 GM OSS lens
- Sony FE 1.4x teleconverter

The 600mm and 300mm lenses are superb lens for bird photography. The 1.4TC extends the 600mm to 840mm and the 300mm to 420mm, two stops down.

## How is this web built?

Hugo, which is a static site generator, is the web framework serving these pages. The source for this website is hosted on GitHub.
Netlify, which runs the web server, automatically picks up changes on the main branch and rebuilds the server. The Hugo theme used is
another open-source project hosted on GitHub.

Every time I change or add pages, I commit the changes to GitHub, and Netlify automatically picks up changes and builds the new server in seconds.
